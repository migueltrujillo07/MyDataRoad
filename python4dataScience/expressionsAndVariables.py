# Expressions: Mathematical Operations 
# 43 + 7 + 8 + 18
# Where the number are called operands and the symbols are called operators
# + --> adition
# - --> Substraction
# * --> multiplication 
# / --> division
# // --> integer division
# Python follows mathematical convntions when performing mathematical expressions

# We use variables to store values
my_variable = 1

# We can store the result of expressions

x = 5 + 6 * 33
# Where the value is 203
print(x)

# Also we can use the variable x to use it in other operation for example:
y = x/33
print(y)
